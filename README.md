eZ NFP FOMC Levels is a TradingView Script that tracks the daily highs and lows for NFP and FOMC for the last several events. These levels have proven important daily levels for most every ticker. Add it to your chart and observe. Then use these levels to supplement your emas, pivots and fibs.

Many thanks to @PaperGainsInc on X for introducing me to the concept!

Happy Trading!

Note: It's not perfect but it works pretty well. If the levels aren't showing or the labels repeat, just switch timeframes and that should fix it.
